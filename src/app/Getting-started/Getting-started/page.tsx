<h1>What is FRC?</h1>
<p>The First Robotics Competition is a yearly competition during the months of January-April</p>
<p>Basically, every year there is a new "theme." They give you a game manual and an introduction video explaining how the new rules work and what was introduced into the game.</p>
<p>Example of a robot design:</p>

<h1>How do you get started with FRC?</h1>
<p>(Follow these steps one after the other depending on if you have that experience or not)</p>
<p>If you have never programmed before, we would recommend: <a href="https://github.com/SciBorgs/SciGuides/blob/main/projects/intro-to-programming/Programming101.md">SciGuides</a></p>
<h2>What programming language should I use?</h2>
<p>Now before you check out the programming tutorials, you may know that wpilib, the <a href="https://www.codingem.com/what-is-a-library/">library</a> used for FRC, let's you use Python, Java, Labview or C++.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about what programming language you should choose, read the "Programming languages in FRC" tab.</p>
<p>If you have programmed before, but you don't know java you should check this out: <a href="https://github.com/SciBorgs/SciGuides/blob/main/projects/intro-to-programming/Java101.md">SciGuides</a> (<strong>After doing this also try Java102</strong>)</p>
<p>Finally, if you have programmed in Java before we would recommend doing this guide: <a href="https://github.com/SciBorgs/SciGuides/blob/main/projects/DifferentialDrive.md">SciGuides</a></p>
<p>It will give you a rundown of a lot of important things related to programming</p>
<h1>Helpful Tips</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>If your in a Robotics team, always ask your veteran/experienced members! <strong>If you don't ask, you will have a tough time learning it yourself!</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Try to read posts on <a href="https://www.chiefdelphi.com/">ChiefDelphi</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Install the tools yourself!</strong> Experiment with AdvantageScope, try modifying your robot's code, install all the FRC tools</p></li>
<li><p>If you are really stuck on something, ask ChatGPT or <a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/">DeepSeek</a></p></li>
